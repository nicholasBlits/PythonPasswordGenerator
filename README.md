# Project Description
This program creates a randomly generated password based on user input.

## Project Requirements
In order to run this program you must have Version 3.9 of Python installed. You can go to [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you do not already have this version of Python installed on your device.

## Project Contents

### main.py

`main.py` is the file used to create the user interface (UI) for the password generator.
All of the generation of the password is processed by this file, which uses methods from `functions.py`.

### functions.py

`functions.py` serves as a regular expression (or regex) creation file.
`functions.py` is imported into `main.py`, and is only ever running when `main.py` makes a call to any of it's methods.

## Copyright Notice

All the code in this interface program has been created by Nicholas Blits, unless specified otherwise through comments in either `functions.py` or `main.py`. 
This may change with future additions made to this program.
